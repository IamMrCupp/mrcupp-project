## Visuals and More
I specialized in audio reactive shader based visual projection using projection mapping. I use a number of tools and software to create and perform visuals for Raves, Festivals and Concerts. I am actively working towards getting my FDA Variance for laser performance in the United States and plan on working more laser and lighting aspects into my visual performances and programmed shows.
