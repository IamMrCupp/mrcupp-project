### About
Born in 2008 as an IRC network that was hosting various chat and control channels for a few internet radio projects and electronics groups that I had been part of. After leaving techno-dnb.com radio in 2008 I launched a streaming radio feed on the original Tech-Noid Systems website. The radio feeds stayed online till about 2014 when there was an issue with the hardware issues that took the project offline.  

2021 and the COVID-19 pandemic hit and I am stuck at home, bored and looking for something to work on again. I decide that it would be fun to relaunch the site with a podcast tied to the collective.

As of 2025, Tech-Noid System is being morphed into a Visual and Audio collective specializing in streaming and live Electronic Music shows.
