# We're Back Baby!

So...that was a long outage huh?  

After moving in July of 2024 and getting everything set up and functional at the new house, we were hit with 3 power outages in 2 months.  Lots of things in the house were impacted from these issues with PG&E, one of them was the kubernetes cluster that hosts all of my personal projects.

After lots waiting on replacement Raspberry Pi devices and new SD-Cards, rebuilding operating systems and reinstalling all the various tools required to get the k8s cluster rebuilt we are finally back up and rolling.

With all luck, the new configuration will be a little more tolerant of issues with the underlying cluster too.
